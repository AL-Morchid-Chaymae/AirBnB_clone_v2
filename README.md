Project Description:

Title: AirBnB Clone - RESTful API

This project is a collaborative effort between Chaymae Al Morchid and Ifeanyi Ezeugwu, focusing on the development of a RESTful API for an AirBnB clone. The goal is to create a back-end system that provides a web server using Python and Flask.

Key Concepts:

REST API: Understanding the principles and implementation of RESTful APIs.
AirBnB Clone: Developing a clone of the AirBnB platform.
Flask: Utilizing the Flask framework for building the API.
API: Understanding what an API is and its significance in software development.
Webserver: Implementing a web server to handle API requests.
Learning Objectives:
By the end of this project, the team aims to achieve a deep understanding of the following concepts:

The meaning of REST and its relevance in API design.
The significance of APIs in software development.
The concept of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and its implementation.
Different types of APIs and their use cases.
HTTP methods for interacting with resources (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Requesting and interacting with REST APIs.
Project Requirements:

Python Scripts: All scripts should adhere to PEP 8 style and use Python 3.4.3.
Documentation: All code should be well-documented, including modules, classes, and functions.
Unit Tests: Unit tests should be implemented using the unittest module, following a specific file organization within the 'tests' folder.
README.md: A README file should be included at the root of the project folder, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running it.
Plagiarism Policy:
The team is reminded of the strict policy against plagiarism. All solutions should be original and developed independently to meet the project's learning objectives. Any form of plagiarism will result in removal from the program.


Overall, this project presents an exciting opportunity for Chaymae Al Morchid and Ifeanyi Ezeugwu to deepen their understanding of RESTful API development using Python and Flask, contributing to their growth as skilled developers.
